					<h4>Description of data</h4>

					<p> An age-old psychological phenomenon is the human drive 
						to compare ourselves to others (Festinger, 1954). <br>
						On top of this, people have the need to belong to groups. 
						Therefore, people categorize themselves into several ingroups, 
						and often compare themselves against an outgroup. <br>
						One often made ingroup is that of one's country (Tajfel, 
						1974). Thus, we often want to compare how our country 
						is doing against others. </p>

					<p> In addition, many people are interested to see how well 
						countries are doing, and how happy a country's population 
						is. <br>
						Several methods of analysis have been used to investigate 
						this and to create an "index" that indicates a countries 
						well-being.<br>
						The Happy Planet Index and the Quality of Life index are 
						two such methods.</p>

					<p> The Happy Planet Index aims to indicate how well countries 
						are doing at achieving long, sustainable and happy lives.<br>
						To measure this, they analyze a country's well-being, 
						life expectancy, inequality between the population 
						(in terms of lifespan and happiness), and ecological footprint.</p>

					<p> The Quality of Life Index, on the other hand, is an 
						estimation of overall quality of life. <br>
						It takes into account health care, safety, purchasing 
						power, pollution, house price to income ratio, cost of 
						living, traffic commute time, and climate.</p>

					<p> Apparently, both indices have different measurements to 
						determine a country's wellbeing. <br>
						Of course, the question is: how well are these two 
						methods at determining how well a country is doing? 
						How do these two indices relate and compare to each other?</p>

					<p> To investigate this issue, this visualization shows the 
						Happy Planet Index and Quality of Life Index for 30 
						European countries.<br>
						The left visualization shows a map with the rank for 
						each country. The right visualization shows a bar chart 
						with each country's rank. <br>
						By using the drop-down button, you can switch between 
						the two datasets. Immediately, it becomes apparent that 
						these scores do not relate to each other that much. <br>
						When switching between datasets, you see that both the 
						colours on the map as well as the bars change per country. </p>

					<p> To zoom in on these differences, it is possible to click 
						on a specific country on the map. The bar chart on the 
						right will then visualize both the HPI rank and the QOL 
						rank. <br>
						Some countries seem to have a similar HPI rank and QOL 
						rank. For instance, the Netherlands ranks third on 
						both measures. <br>
						However, there are also countries that score quite 
						differently on both indices. Estonia, for example, 
						scores 30th on the HPI Rank, but 8th on the QOL rank. <br>
						Another example is Spain, which scores 2nd on the 
						HPI Rank, but 11th on the QOL Rank. </p>

					<p> Thus, this visualization shows that "well-being" can be 
						defined in different ways, and that these methods of 
						determining well-being can result in different outcomes. <br>
						In addition, a bad score on one of these indices might 
						not mean that a country is actually doing badly in terms 
						of well-being, as this ultimately depends on the measurements. <br>
						This visualization thus nicely underscores the importance 
						of not relying on a single experiment or dataset to 
						investigate a certain issue or prove a certain hypothesis. <br>
						So remember, validation of measures, using multiple 
						measurement methods and replication of results is necessary to make strong claims!</p>

					<p> To conlude, this visualization leaves us with one 
						remaining question that might never be answered:</p>
